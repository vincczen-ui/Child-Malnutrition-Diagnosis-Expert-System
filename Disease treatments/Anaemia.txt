Iron supplements can be helpful when the child finds it difficult to take in enough iron through only dietary measures, 
such as in a plant-based diet. 

It is better to try to consume enough in the diet alone by removing or reducing factors that may hinder iron absorption and consuming iron-rich foods.
This is because many iron-rich foods also contain a range of other beneficial nutrients that work together to support overall health.
