Initial treatment of marasmus often includes dried skim milk powder mixed with boiled water. 
Later, the mixture can also include a vegetable oil such as sesame, casein, and sugar. Casein is milk protein. The oil increases the energy content and density of the mixture.
Once a child starts to recover, they should have a more balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs.

If dehydration is a problem because of diarrhea, rehydration should also be a priority. 
A child may not necessarily need fluids delivered intravenously. Oral hydration may be sufficient.
Infections are common among children with marasmus, so treatment with antibiotics or other medications is standard. 
Treating infections and any other health issues can help give them the best chance of recovery.
