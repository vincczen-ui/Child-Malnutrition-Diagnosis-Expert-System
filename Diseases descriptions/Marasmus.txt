Marasmus is a form of severe malnutrition. 
It can occur in children who have severe malnutrition, but it usually occurs in children. 
It typically occurs in developing countries. Marasmus can be life-threatening, but you can get treatment for it.

The main symptom of marasmus is being underweight. 
Children with this condition have lost a lot of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat. 
Subcutaneous fat is the layer of fat just under the skin. 
Dry skin and brittle hair are also symptoms of marasmus.
Seriously malnourished children may look older and have little to no energy or enthusiasm for anything.
